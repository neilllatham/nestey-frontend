Loading data as an employee

To switch from employee 2 to employee 5, you only need to change two lines in timeoff.js:

Read timeoff.js, lines 52 to 58

Read timeoff.js, lines 120 to 130

Here are the exact locations in timeoff.js:

Line 56: Change const employeeId = 2; to const employeeId = 5;
Line 128: Change employee_id: 2, to employee_id: 5,

That's it! Both lines have a TODO comment showing where the hardcoded employee ID is used:

Line 56 controls which employee's balances are loaded
Line 128 controls which employee submits the time off request
Once you change both 2 to 5, reload the page and you'll see employee 5's balances and any new requests will be created for employee 5.
